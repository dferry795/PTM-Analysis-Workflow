# PTM-Analysis-Workflow

## Introduction
*This is the workflow created by group #7 for our 2025 Senior Bioinformatics Capstone project at Brigham Young University. Below are detailed steps for reproducibility.* 

## First: downloading data
We took raw data from the PTM_Disrupting_Mutations.csv and TCGA datasets, which are found in the data folder of this repository. 

## Second: Inner join TCGA and PTM Disrupting data in R

## Third: Plot Mutation Frequency

## Fourth: Plotting IDR along with mutations

## Fifth: Using Chimera to plot 3-dimensionality
