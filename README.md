## Introduction
*This is the workflow for our 2025 Senior Bioinformatics Capstone project at Brigham Young University. 
This project is a collaboration with the Huntsman Cancer Institute.
Below are detailed steps for reproducibility.* 

## First: downloading data
We took raw data from two websites, TCGA data from the National Cancer Institute (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) as well as PTM disrupting mutational data (https://ptmd.biocuckoo.cn/download.php).

The TCGA data shows the most frequent mutations across all cancer types. This data is called ***TCGA_Frequent_Mutations.tsv*** and is located in the data/ directory of this github.

The PTM disrupting data shows all mutations which disrupt a PTM across the genome. This data is called ***PTM_Disrupting_Mutations.csv*** and is located in the data/ directory of this github.

Feel free to download these two data files directly from this github in the data/ directory to begin.

## Second: Inner join TCGA and PTM Disrupting data in R

## Third: Plot Mutation Frequency

## Fourth: Plotting IDR along with mutations

## Fifth: Using Chimera to plot 3-dimensionality
